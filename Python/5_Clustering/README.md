## Introduction

Here is the file structure of this project:

	-- iris
		-- iris.py (the main program output the result of clustering result.)
		-- dataset
			-- iris.txt
	-- titanic	
		-- titanic.py (the main program, output the result of standardization and no -standardization, as the result is high related to the initial centroids, so the result maybe different.)		
		-- dataset
			-- titanic.xls
	requirement.txt (some basic libraty, matplotlib for plot, numpy for basic list operation, pandas for read .xls file, and sklearn for standardization, not necessary, just for comparison.)
	
I have write some test codes and comparison codes on the main program, but I commented them, you can choose any text-editor (like Atom, VScode) you like to uncomment those codes to get some different results.


## Preliminary

The program is based on Python3.6.1, please make sure you have installed Python3.6 on your machine before run it.

And please run this code before run the program:
	
	pip install -r requirements.txt
